# SAN
String Army Knife is a Javascript string excessory set of tools for cross browser, node, and other js platforms

The SAN library contains the various commonly needed string utilities, namely:
* Gret      - an extended RegEx class with some very useful methods that were an obvious oversite in the ECMA specs and also "cleaners" which are a loadable library of functions like "encode", "escape", "pack", "sprintf" and their compliments.
* JSON      - nothing fancy it just somee obvious replacer and reviver callbacks for JSON.stringify and JSON.parse

Soon to come:
* AnsiPain  - why? because we had nothing better to do, but it's the best thing yet for ansi ui.  not uploaded until I finalize the design and structure.
* Builder   - a string builder following Java's StringBuilder class
* Chain     - basically an array of strings and placeholders, a code side non-template system if you will
